### Remarks
We can observe that the **Model Accuracy is increasing** **with the increase of training data**. And finally it saturates.
The best hyperparamter **gamma value is 0.001**
# Part 2 : Comparing actual Predictions based on Confusion matrix

### Remarks
We can observe that the number of **misclassified samples are reducing** for each class **with increase of training data**
Also, number of **correctly classified samples are increasing** for each class **with increase of training data**
