These are the results of two questions 
1. if you give n=100 samples, and provide train:test:valid split as 70:20:10, there should be 70,20, and 10 samples in the train, tests, and validation splits returned by `create_split` function.

2. given n=9 samples, with 70:20:10 split, the train should contain 6, 2, 1 samples respectively.
